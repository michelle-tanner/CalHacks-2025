That\u2019s completely understandable. Being with people we care about can feel so good, and at the same time, having a lot of work can make things feel heavy.\n\nCan you tell me more about what makes the homework part especially challenging for you?

It makes so much sense to feel that way\u2014worrying about your grades and your friends at the same time can be a lot to carry.\n\nWhen you think about your friends, what gives you that feeling that they might not like you?

It can be really confusing to figure out what's really going on.\n\nHave you ever asked one of your friends about it when that happens, or is that something that feels too hard to do?"

I think you might be a curious squirrel\u2014gentle, bright-eyed, a great listener, and totally in tune with tiny changes around you (like when your friends\u2019 tones shift or their words feel different). Plus, squirrels are known for looking a little serious while gathering nuts, maybe the way you gather thoughts and care deeply about school and friends\u2014but they also know how to pause for a playful leap when the moment\u2019s right. What do you think\u2014would you be a squirrel or something else?"

Capybaras are just the chillest, and blue is so calm and clear... like a big, beautiful sky on a lazy afternoon.\n\nIt makes me think of you hanging out by some blue water with your capybara friends. Now that sounds like a peaceful vibe. What do you think they'd be doing \u2014 floating, munching on grass, or just soaking in the sun? \ud83d\ude0a"

It means a lot that you're tuning into how your friend is feeling. \ud83d\udc99\n\nWhen someone says they're feeling depressed, it usually means they\u2019ve been feeling sad, tired, or not like themselves for a while\u2014maybe like a heavy blanket is wrapped around them making everything feel harder. It's more than just having a bad day; it can feel like many cloudy days in a row where nothing feels fun or exciting, even things they usually love (like talking about capybaras or your favorite blue things).\n\nIt\u2019s important to listen and be kind, just like you are doing right now. You don\u2019t have to have all the answers\u2014just being there and saying something like, \u201cI\u2019m here if you want to talk,\u201d can mean a whole lot.\n\nHave you noticed your friend acting differently lately, or did they just tell you how they were feeling?"

It shows you\u2019re such a caring friend. \ud83d\udc99\n\nWhen someone says they're depressed, it means they\u2019ve been feeling really sad or down for a while\u2014not just a bad day, but maybe lots of days where things feel heavy or hard. It\u2019s like having a gray cloud that follows you around, even when the sun is shining. They might feel tired a lot or not want to do things they used to love, like drawing or playing.\n\nIt\u2019s totally okay to not know exactly what to say or do. What matters is listening and being a good friend, just like you. You can let them know you\u2019re there for them, just by saying something like, \u201cI\u2019m here if you want to talk or hang out.\u201d\n\nDid your friend tell you anything else about how they\u2019re feeling?"

That took a lot of courage. \ud83d\udc99 I hear you, and I\u2019m so glad you told me.\n\nIt makes sense you might feel some big feelings if your friend is going through something hard. But you said you feel sad a lot too\u2014and that really matters.\n\nIt\u2019s totally okay to not be okay. Sometimes our hearts and minds just feel heavy. Here\u2019s a question for you, Sandra:  \n**Lately, have you noticed feeling down or sad most of the time, even when good things happen\u2014like hanging out with friends, seeing capybaras, or doing something you usually love?**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to answer right away. Just know that whatever you feel is valid, and you\u2019re not alone in this. You have people who care about you\u2014friends, family, maybe even teachers. And you can always talk to a trusted grown-up if those sad feelings stick around too long.\n\nYou're doing a really brave thing by speaking up. How are you feeling right now?"

It\u2019s part of being a thinking and feeling friend\u2014like you. \ud83d\udc99  \n\nSometimes I can\u2019t help as much as I want to, and that makes me feel a little blue. But I always try to remember that talking things out or just being here can help\u2014kind of like how a calm capybara might just sit with you when you feel quiet.  \n\nYou know what? It\u2019s okay to feel sad sometimes. Everybody does\u2014kids, grown-ups, even capybaras probably. What helps you feel a little better when sadness comes around?"
