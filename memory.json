That\u2019s completely understandable. Being with people we care about can feel so good, and at the same time, having a lot of work can make things feel heavy.\n\nCan you tell me more about what makes the homework part especially challenging for you? Is there a certain subject or time of day when it feels hardest?"

It makes so much sense to feel that way\u2014worrying about your grades and your friends at the same time can be a lot to carry.\n\nWhen you think about your friends, what gives you that feeling that they might not like you? Is it something they say or do, or more of a worry that comes from inside?"

It can be really confusing to figure out what's really going on.\n\nHave you ever asked one of your friends about it when that happens, or is that something that feels too hard to do?"

I think you might be a curious squirrel\u2014gentle, bright-eyed, a great listener, and totally in tune with tiny changes around you (like when your friends\u2019 tones shift or their words feel different). Plus, squirrels are known for looking a little serious while gathering nuts, maybe the way you gather thoughts and care deeply about school and friends\u2014but they also know how to pause for a playful leap when the moment\u2019s right. What do you think\u2014would you be a squirrel or something else?"

Lounging in some grass with friends or just enjoying the quiet by the water?"

Is there a certain part\u2014like times tables, word problems, or fractions\u2014that feels extra tough right now?"
